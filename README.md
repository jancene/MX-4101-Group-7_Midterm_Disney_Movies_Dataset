>>Length (LEN): *Returns the length of a text string.*

>>Upper (UPPER): *Converts all characters in a text string to uppercase.*

>>Lower (LOWER): *Converts all characters in a text string to lowercase.*

>>Mid (MID): *Extracts a specific number of characters from a text string, starting at a specified position.*

## Math Functions
A math function is a built-in mathematical operation or formula that you can use to perform various calculations on numerical data in your spreadsheets. These functions make it easier to perform complex mathematical operations without having to write custom formulas. 

>>Greatest Common Denominator (GCD): *Returns the largest positive integer that is a divisor of all the given integers.*

>>Average (AVERAGE): *Returns the average of the given numbers.*

>>Absolute Value (ABS): *Returns the non-negative absolute value of the given number.*

>>Square Root(SQRT): *Returns the square root of the given number.*

>>Sign (SIGN): *Returns the sign of the given number. The sign of a number is either 1 (positive), 0 (zero), or -1 (negative).*

## Logical Functions
A logical function is a built-in functions that allows you to perform operations based on logical conditions or criteria. These functions help you make decisions, evaluate data, and perform tasks based on whether certain conditions are met. Logical functions return either TRUE or FALSE as their results, which are commonly used for conditional formatting, data analysis, and complex decision-making within spreadsheets. 

>>IF Function (IF): *Returns one value if a condition is met, and another value if the condition is not met.*

>>OR Function (OR): *Returns true if any of the given conditions are true, and false if all of the conditions are false.*

>>NOT Function (NOT): *Returns the opposite of the given Boolean value.* 

>>XOR Function (XOR): *Returns true if exactly one of the given conditions is true, and false otherwise.*

>>ISBLANK Function (ISBLANK): *Returns true if the given cell is blank, and false otherwise.*

## Information Functions
Information functions provide information about the content, formatting and location of cells in an Excel Worksheet.

>>ISERROR Function (ISERROR): *Returns true if the value of the cell is an error, false otherwise*

>>ISNUMBER Function (ISNUMBER): *Returns true if the value of the cell is a number, false otherwise.*

>>ISTEXT Function (ISTEXT): *Returns true if the value of the cell is text, false otherwise.*

>>ISNA Function (ISNA): *Returns true if the value of the cell is #N/A, false otherwise.*

>>ISREF Function (ISREF): *Returns true if the value of the cell is a reference to another cell or range of cells, false otherwise.*

## Date and Time Functions
Date and Time functions provides a variety of functions for working with dates and times. These functions allow you to perform calculations, manipulate dates and times, and format them as needed. 
 
 >>WEEKNUM Function (WEEKNUM): *Returns the week number of a date, according to the specified locale.*

>>DAY Function (WEEKNUM): *Returns the week number of a date, according to the specified locale.*

>>MONTH Function (MONTH): *Returns the month number from a date.*

>>YEAR Function (YEAR): *Returns the year number from a date.*

>>DATE Function (DATE): *Creates a date from the specified year, month, and day.*

>>EOMONTH Function (EOMONTH): *Returns the last day of the month for a specified date.*

## Lookup Functions
Lookup functions are used to search for a specific value in a range or table of data and return related information from that range. These functions are extremely useful for tasks such as finding corresponding values, performing approximate matches, and retrieving data from large datasets.

>>LOOKUP Function (LOOKUP): *Returns a value from a table based on a given value.*

>>ADDRESS Function (ADDRESS): *Returns the cell address of a cell based on a given row and column number.*

>>MATCH Function (MATCH): *Returns the position of a value in a table.*

>>CHOOSE Function (CHOOSE): *Returns a value from a list of values based on a given index number.*

>>COLUMN Function (COLUMN): *Returns the column number of a cell.*
